## Abstract

This application is utilized to pratice flashcards in the terminal. Using a preset dataset. We have an array of flashcards objects, with properties of questions, possible answers, and the answer. The terminal will go through each flash card where the user can answer, and then receive their percentage of correct answers at the end of the round.
